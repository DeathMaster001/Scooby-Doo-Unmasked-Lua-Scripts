# Scooby-Doo! Unmasked Lua Tool
A repository of Lua scripts made specifically for the GameCube game Scooby-Doo! Unmasked (G5DE78). Intended to be used by speedrunners, glitch hunters and TAS creators.

## Planned Features (All Toggleable)
- Stats (Health, Total Health, Mubber, Level Name's)
- Collectables (Food, Clues and Costume Tokens)
- Input Viewer and Position Viewer

## How to Use
In order to use this tool you are required to use a custom version of Dolphin specificly built for TAS creation called [Dolphin Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core).

Once you have downloaded this build, you will need to place the contents of the latest release into the '/sys/scripts/' folder found inside your dolphin lua core install folder.

Once the scripts are in the proper path, open the Dolphin Lua Core Emulator and follow the [Running Scripts](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core#running-scripts) section of the Dolphin Lua Core Github Repository to execute the scripts.

## Unmasked Windowed Tool
If your interested I've made a similar tool that works separately with Dolphin, check it out [here](https://github.com/DeathMaster001/Scooby-Doo-Unmasked-Windowed-Tool).
